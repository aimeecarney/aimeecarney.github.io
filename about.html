<p>Hi! My name is Aimee McGrenera, I'm a marketing professional by day and a student enrolled in the Learn-Verified Full Stack Web Development program by night. I have always loved solving problems and puzzles. While I may be extremely indecisive on what to eat for dinner, big life decisions have always shown a clear path to me. When I was introduced to coding, I fell in love with how hard yet rewarding it is and knew I wanted to start a career in web development. Iâ€™m eager and thrilled to start this new chapter of my life. </p>
