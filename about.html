<p>Hi! My name is Aimee Carney and I am currently enrolled in the Learn-Verified Full Stack Web Development program through the Flatiron School. I have always loved solving problems and puzzles. I am the type of person who knows what they want. While I may be extremely indecisive on what to eat for dinner, big life decisions have always shown a clear path to me, once I know I want something I will stop at nothing to achieve it. When I was introduced to coding, I loved how hard yet satisfying it can be and knew I wanted to start a career in web development. I am ready and excited to start a new chapter of my life and a new passion. </p>
