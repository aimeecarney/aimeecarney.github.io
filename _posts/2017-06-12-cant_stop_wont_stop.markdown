“If you can’t stop thinking about it, don’t stop working on it” - Michael Jordan
 
I’ve found in life that as much as I want to compartmentalize areas and focuses in my life it’s nearly impossible. While I am at work I am constantly thinking about what I am learning in web development and itching for the work day to be over so I can learn more and *develop* my web *development* skills even more. I find myself constantly talking to my friends, family, finance and even my dog, about what I am learning. And since I clearly can’t stop thinking or talking about coding, MJ suggests that I shouldn’t stop working on it. 
 
And funny enough, my worlds are beginning to collide, so I don’t have to stop working on it. I work at a company with various online stores accompained by various outlets and platforms that the products can be sold on. As our product line constantly changes I have to update all these platforms (or as I know now, databases) with updated information. Which made learning SQL, ORMs and ActiveRecord very easy, as I was able to connect it to my current job. I was learning the mechanics behind something I do on a daily basis. Being able to connect and make sense of what I was learning brought coding into perspective to me. It’s not just about completing labs and assignments, I was able to apply it and understand better how it translates into real life situations.
