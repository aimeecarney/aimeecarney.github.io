What I love about this curriculum is how you really learn how to do the nitty gritty, you learn the basics and how everything works, so when you get to ActiveRecord you know exactly what is behind that method. You know the lines of code that make up the simple now one line of .create. 

As I near the end of the Sinatra section I am finally seeing myself start to become a developer, not just a student. I am now seeing my code locally live with shotgun, I am combining erb views with controllers and seeing these sites play out.
 
While I am still having to ask endless questions I am thoroughly enjoying the learning process and loving how it all starts to click and make sense step by step.
