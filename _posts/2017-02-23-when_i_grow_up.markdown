Go to College --> Get good grades --> Graduate --> Get a job

My whole life I followed the steps to become a “successful” adult. However, along the way I never found a study I was truly passionate about (for perspective I changed my major 5 times).

Upon graduating college, I found myself at a stopping point. Now what? I had no idea "what I wanted to be when I grow up” except I was done growing, there was no more "when I grow up" left.

My only direction, was that my whole life I wanted to work in the music industry. I was doing various internships while working serving and bartending jobs to get my foot in the door; and it finally paid off. I landed what I thought was my dream job.

I was working as an agent’s assistant at a music booking agency. With the intentions of becoming an agent myself. We were working with all the artists I loved. This was it. I had found my calling.

Except as the years went on I found it to be very demanding and unrewarding. I worked long hours of monotonous work, I started to despise the artists I used to love and it began to take the fun out of why I wanted to work in the music industry. On top of that, it didn't help that I was getting paid less than what I made as a bartender.  It lead me to take another job as an in-house marketing coordinator in a completely different industry.

And once again, I found myself asking myself the same question, "what do I want to be when I grow up?".
  
I had taken a computer science class back in high school and enjoyed it, and working with html at current jobs piqued that interest again.

My brother knew I was at this crossroad and since he lives in NYC and is in the tech world, he had known about The Flatiron School and introduced it to me. I decided to give the boot camp prep course a chance and I fell in love with coding. And with a push from my Fiancé I decided to take the leap and apply to Learn.co's Full Stack Web Development program.

So now here I am. I know I have a long way to go (and working full time is not going to be fun) but I have never felt this way about a study or field before in my life. It feels the exact opposite of what I felt in what I deemed my "Dream Job". I'll be working for what feels like an hour, yet three have passed by. I love that every time, I am creating something new; and even though it is extremely frustrating, it is also one of the most satisfying and accomplishing feelings I have ever experienced. Cheers to finally knowing what I want to be when I grow up!
