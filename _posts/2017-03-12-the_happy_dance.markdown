I started my coding journey a little over a month ago now. When I decided to take this path and hit the reset button on my career, I knew it would be a challenge, it was definitely not an ideal time to change careers. I had recently taken on many different hats: I was a new employee, a wedding planner and a first time homeowner. Financially and mentally I knew it was going to be a struggle. 

After numerous discussions and conversations with family and friends something my fiancé said stuck with me and has stuck with me throughout the entire process thus far. He said “If it was easy everyone would be doing it, the most rewarding experiences are usually also the most intimidating”. This experience has been nothing short of challenging, frustrating and rewarding all at the same time. And I have just scraped the surface. 

After every lab completed comes a huge sense of accomplishment trailed by more frustration on the following lab, until it registers and makes sense (or after you ask a million questions and participate in endless screen shares). I didn’t notice that after every lab I accomplished I partook in a happy dance, until my dog started joining in. When I realized this, it confirmed that I had made the right decision. Not once in my entire career before, have the work I’ve completed enacted this happy dance. Which might be a good thing, because believe me this dance is not very pretty (for reference, it's extremely similar to [The Carlton](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/freshprince/images/d/d2/Carlton_Dance.gif/revision/latest?cb=20150313113102)). 

Coding is an endless rollercoaster of emotions that keeps going. There are high highs and low lows. There are times when you want to throw your computer and never look at terminal typeface ever again. But you keep going because when it finally clicks the happy dance commences and you've built something.
